description: Archive of analog photography taken using various refurbished film cameras.
text: From childhood summers spent in my grandfatherâ€™s workshop to repairing with cameras and record players, I have always enjoyed experimenting with things. Analog photography offers a satisfying visual feedback to any changes one makes. The Mamiya that I reconstructed for the first photo does not lock the shutter after the first image is capured encouraging working with multiple exposures. The Canon Half Frame used in the second is perfect for dyptics and later images were inspired by the reaction of Cine film to bright lights.

title: "Lighting Design"
description: Archive of lighting design at the ADC Theatre in Cambridge.
text: Whilst at university I did lighting design for a number of shows at our student theatre culminating in a sold out run of the Footlights Pantomime. I enjoyed being able to sculpt with light and convey feeling and mood to the audience. I focused on creating graphic, striking scenes with vivid colour over realism.<br><br>The photography in this section is courtesy of Johannes Hjorth.

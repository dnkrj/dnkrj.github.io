title: "Masks"
description: Art project culminating in a series of watercolour paintings of masked figures.
text: Inspired by the work of Saul Steinberg and Inge Morath, I produced a series of paintings of suited men with paper bags on their heads. By removing the faces on the bags I wished to highlight the anonymity given to people - particularly city workers - in a city like London. The children's book illustration style, in part influenced by Aubrey Beardsley, was guided by the transition from person to “character” when one is masked.
medium: Concentrated watercolor on cartridge paper.

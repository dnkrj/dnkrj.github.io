title: In a Hole in the Ground
description: An art project culminating in a A1 watercolour on book pages.
text: In this set of works I aimed to visualise the feeling of finding a new world in the pages of a book. Placing reduced figures into small scenes expands the environment whilst maintaining the comfort of a smaller space. To increase the feeling of exploration and to echo the pages of a book, I used foam board to add depth to pieces. The use of watercolour was influenced by illustrations such as those of Arthur Rackham for Alice in Wonderland.
medium: Concentrated watercolour and foam board.

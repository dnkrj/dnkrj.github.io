    <p>In my final year of university, I was on the committee for my college's biennial ball.</p>
    <p>In my position as webmaster and head of ticketing, I built a Django based ticketing website with Stripe integration which allowed for easy ticket purchasing for over 1400 guests with page response times of under 10ms at peak load.</p>
    <p>For entry on the door I connected six barcode scanners to Nexus 7 tablets using USB OTG running a custom Android application and connected to a local network to allow entry using NFC and barcoded tickets. My system halved the total time taken to admit our guests.</p>

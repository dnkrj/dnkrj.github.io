    <p>From childhood summers spent in my grandfatherâ€™s workshop to repairing with cameras and record players, I have always enjoyed experimenting with things. Analog photography offers a satisfying visual feedback to any changes one makes.</p>
    <p>The Mamiya that I reconstructed for the first photo does not lock the shutter after the first image is capured encouraging working with multiple exposures.</p>
    <p>The Canon Half Frame used in the second is perfect for dyptics and later images were inspired by the reaction of Cine film to bright lights.</p>

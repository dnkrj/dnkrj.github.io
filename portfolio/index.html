    <p class="isAlwaysOn">Hi, I'm Daniel, this page details my journey in sharing my ideas through technology, design and art.</p>
    <p>Press a key on your keyboard, some of the crosses to the right will stop, they represent cars. I built the simulation to show a friend how his driving style affects a larger network. <a href="/traffic/">More on Traffic</a>.</p>
    <p>Right now I'm working on Google Calendar. Whilst Traffic changed the minds of a few friends, working on Calendar lets me help hundreds of millions of users. <a href="googlecalendar/">More on Calendar</a>.</p>
    <p>Being able to make things and share them with the world is something that I have always found deeply inspiring. In my undergraduate degree, I led a team of students building a web app to share life streaming videos online. <a href="voio/">More on Voio</a>.</p>
    <p>As the web progresses, we are using it to share more and more information. For my undergraduate dissertation, I worked on a scalable server to handle the quantity of data from internet of things devices. <a href="dissertation/">More on Transport Data Web Server</a>.</p>
    <p>Sharing things on the web is really about sharing experiences, ideas and emotions. In efforts toward this, I have played with a variety of media including posters, magazines and clothing as well as more abstract forms such as lighting. <a href="assortedgraphicdesign/">More on Graphic Design</a>.</p>
    <p>For me personally I have found a lot of enjoyment in photography, shaping the world into interesting, beautiful and graphic imagery. <a href="photography/">More on Photography</a>.</p>
    <p>Painting and Drawing has provided me with even more flexibility to convey ideas. Highlighted here is a project built to convey the feeling of finding a new world in the pages of a book. <a href="inaholeintheground/">More on In a Hole in the Ground</a>.</p>

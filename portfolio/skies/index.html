    <p>In my paintings of skies I used thin layers of semi-transparent oil paint to emulate the layers of sky and to abstract away from a single image of a single sky and inspired by Idris Kahn’s layered photographs.</p>
    <p>In terms of painting technique, I was mostly heavily influenced by J. M. W. Turner’s expressive watercolours, but I experimented with a wide variety of media; watercolour, enamels, oils, inks, fabrics, foil and various paper surfaces.</p>
    <p>This painting was exhibited in the Mall Gallery as part of the National Students' Exhbition.</p>

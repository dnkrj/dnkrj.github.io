<h2>Skies</h2>
<p>In my paintings of skies I used thin layers of semi-transparent oil paint to emulate the layers of sky and abstract away from a single image of a single sky inspired by Idris Kahn’s layered photographs. In terms of painting technique, I was mostly heavily influenced by J. M. W. Turner’s expressive watercolours, but I experimented with a wide variety of media; watercolour, enamels, oils, inks, fabrics, foil and various paper surfaces. This painting was exhibited in the Mall Gallery as part of the National Students' Exhbition.</p>
